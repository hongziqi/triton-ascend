# Coverage Runner

`build-tools/coverage/run.py` runs coverage-enabled tests and generates `lcov` / `genhtml` reports.

## Requirements

- Build the project with `./build-tools/build.sh --coverage`.
- Install `lcov`, `genhtml`, and `llvm-cov`.
- On Ubuntu, `genhtml` is installed together with the `lcov` package.
- The runner uses `llvm-cov` from `PATH`. LLVM 18 is recommended; other versions will print a warning.
- `lit` mode requires `<build-dir>/bin/llvm-lit`.
- `gtest --build-target ...` requires `ninja`.

Install the report tools on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y lcov llvm-18
```

Check the environment before running coverage:

```bash
which lcov
which genhtml
which llvm-cov
llvm-cov --version
```

If `/usr/lib/llvm-18` does not exist, install the LLVM 18 package first:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y llvm-18
```

If LLVM 18 is installed but `which llvm-cov` still prints nothing, add the LLVM 18 tool directory to `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-18/bin:$PATH
which llvm-cov
```

## Build

```bash
rm -rf ./build-cov && mkdir build-cov
./build-tools/build.sh --coverage \
  --build-triton \
  --disable-cann \
  --enable-lld \
  --disable-mlir-werror \
  --disable-bishengir-werror \
  --disable-werror \
  --enable-assertion \
  --build-type="Release" \
  --build=./build-cov
```

## Run Lit Coverage

Run all `bishengir/test` cases with 4 workers:

```bash
python3 build-tools/coverage/run.py lit \
  --build-dir ./build-cov \
  --lit-test-root ./bishengir/test \
  --jobs 4 \
  --out-dir ./build-cov/coverage-bishengir-full
```

Run one lit case:

```bash
python3 build-tools/coverage/run.py lit \
  --build-dir ./build-cov \
  --lit-test-root ./bishengir/test \
  --test bishengir/test/bishengir-opt/commandline.mlir \
  --jobs 1 \
  --out-dir ./build-cov/coverage-one-lit
```

The runner deletes old `.gcda` files under `--build-dir` before each run. If lit fails after generating `.gcda` files, the runner still generates the coverage report and then returns non-zero.

## Run GTest Coverage

Run one gtest binary:

```bash
python3 build-tools/coverage/run.py gtest \
  --build-dir ./build-cov \
  --binary tools/bishengir/unittests/Dialect/Utils/BiShengIRDialectUtilsTests \
  --out-dir ./build-cov/coverage-gtest
```

Build the gtest target first and run one test filter:

```bash
python3 build-tools/coverage/run.py gtest \
  --build-dir ./build-cov \
  --build-target BiShengIRDialectUtilsTests \
  --binary tools/bishengir/unittests/Dialect/Utils/BiShengIRDialectUtilsTests \
  --gtest-filter 'SelectRoundModeTest.*' \
  --out-dir ./build-cov/coverage-gtest
```

## Outputs

Each run writes these files under `--out-dir`:

- `coverage.info`: raw lcov capture result
- `coverage.filtered.info`: result after extracting `*/bishengir/*`
- `coverage.cleaned.info`: result after removing paths listed in `build-tools/coverage/blacklist.py`
- `html/index.html`: final HTML report

Open the HTML entry directly, for example:

```bash
xdg-open ./build-cov/coverage-bishengir-full/html/index.html
```

## Diff File Coverage

Use `--diff-range` to filter the coverage report to only include files changed in a git diff range. The runner collects full coverage data as usual, then filters `coverage.cleaned.info` to only keep files listed by `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMRT <range>`. The resulting `html/index.html` only shows coverage for those files — unchanged files are excluded.

This is **file-level** filtering: any file that appears in the diff is kept in full with its line-level coverage detail. It does not restrict to changed lines only.

If the diff range returns no files, or none of the diff files match any coverage records, the runner exits with a clear error instead of producing an empty report.

A common use case is filtering coverage to a pull request diff, e.g. `origin/A5/dev...HEAD`. The flag accepts any range that `git diff` understands: branch names, commit SHAs, or `origin/<branch>...HEAD`.

Example — collect coverage for `bishengir/test` lit tests, then report only files changed between `origin/A5/dev` and the current branch:

```bash
python3 build-tools/coverage/run.py lit \
  --build-dir ./build-cov \
  --lit-test-root ./bishengir/test \
  --jobs 4 \
  --diff-range "origin/A5/dev...HEAD" \
  --out-dir ./build-cov/coverage-diff
```

The same flag works with gtest mode:

```bash
python3 build-tools/coverage/run.py gtest \
  --build-dir ./build-cov \
  --binary tools/bishengir/unittests/Dialect/Utils/BiShengIRDialectUtilsTests \
  --diff-range "origin/A5/dev...HEAD" \
  --out-dir ./build-cov/coverage-diff
```

When `--diff-range` is omitted, the runner behaves exactly as before.

## Useful Options

- `--out-dir`: output directory. Default is `<build-dir>/coverage`.
- `--jobs`: lit worker count and gtest pre-build parallelism.
- `--test`: lit test file or directory. Can be passed multiple times.
- `--diff-range`: git diff range to filter coverage to changed files only.
