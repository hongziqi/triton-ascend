## Development Tips

### Code style

This repository follows the LLVM community coding standards and style. See the [LLVM Coding Standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html). You can use the following tools for style checks:

- [Clang-Tidy](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/.clang-tidy)
- [CppLint](https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint)
- [Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/)
- [CMakeLint](https://github.com/cmake-lint/cmake-lint)

### Submitting a PR

- Open an Issue on [GitCode](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/AscendNPU-IR) to propose your idea.
- If the change involves non-trivial design, submit a design document as well.
- After the Issue and design (if any) are agreed upon, fork the repo, implement, and open a PR.
- The PR will be merged, rejected, or closed based on the discussion.
- Merging requires 2 Reviewers to comment `/lgtm` (Looks Good To Me) and 1 Approver to comment `/approve`. The PR author cannot merge their own PR.

### Fork–Pull workflow

Before submitting code to AscendNPU-IR, fork the project to your own repository. Develop in your fork and submit a Pull Request to merge your changes into this project.

### Self-testing your changes

After making code changes, build and run tests in the build directory to verify:

```bash
ninja check-bishengir
```

### Pushing and CI

After your changes pass local tests, push your commits to your remote fork.

### Creating a Pull Request to the upstream repo

After pushing to your fork, create a Pull Request from your branch to the AscendNPU-IR master branch. After creating the PR, you can comment `compile` in the PR to trigger the CI pipeline. We recommend merging your PR into upstream master as soon as it is approved to reduce merge conflicts.

### Dealing with CI failures

Common CI failure types and how to address them:

- **Build failure**: Check the CI log for the cause, fix the issue, and ensure the project builds locally before pushing again.
- **Static analysis failure**: Locate and fix the issues reported by the static checker.
- **CI Pipeline / test failure**: Identify the failing tests from the CI output, fix them, and re-trigger CI.

## Notes

- Avoid including changes unrelated to the PR in your commits.
- Keep commit history clear and logical (squash or rebase when appropriate).
- Rebase your branch onto the latest upstream master before opening a PR.
- For bug-fix PRs, reference all related Issues and PRs in the PR description.
